# Smashing RSA for fun and profit?!
Is it possible to break the RSA public-key cryptosystem which is commonly used in encryption/decryption operations of contemporary mediums of secure communication?

## ... But how tho?
One of the simplest attack that can be performed on RSA (and also one of the extremely rare one to happen in the real world) is called as _common modulus attack_. In here we will try to break RSA (get the plaintext _M_) by two different ciphertexts that is acquired with the same modulus _N_ of the same plaintext. You can get a more detailed explanation about [this](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/rsa-attacks-common-modulus-7bdb34f331a5) simple attack from this medium article, enjoy :blush:
